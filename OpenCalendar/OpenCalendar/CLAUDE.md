# Calendar App - iOS

## Project Overview
A native iOS calendar app built in Swift/SwiftUI focused on UX and UI design taste. This is a personal project to showcase product design and development skills.

## Tech Stack
- Swift/SwiftUI
- SwiftData for local persistence
- SF Symbols for icons
- iOS 17+ target

## Design Principles
- Clean, minimal interface prioritizing visual hierarchy
- Smooth 60fps animations and transitions
- Native iOS patterns and conventions
- First focused on daily/weekly views optimized for mobile

## Key Features to Build
1. Week view with 96 15-minutes time slots (00:00 - 00:00)
2. Day view for focused single-day planning
3. Event creation by tapping time slots
4. Event editing and deletion
5. Clean event cards with title, time, optional notes
6. Smooth scrolling and gesture interactions

## Development Approach
- Start with single day layout
- Build iteratively, one feature at a time
- Test frequently in Xcode simulator
- Prioritize feel and polish over feature scope

## Notes for Claude Code
- Explain SwiftUI patterns when introducing new concepts
- Favor modern Swift idioms and SwiftUI best practices
- Keep views small and composable
- Use descriptive variable names for clarity
